## Projects

### 1. HorusEyeIntelliCancerSystem (Graduation Project):

**Description:**
HorusEye is an advanced cancer management system (combining both knowledge in information systems and artificial intelligence technqiues) that supports adding doctors, patients, and radiation therapists, with authenticated doctor accounts enabling patient registration, information exploration, and profile updates. Each patient has follow-ups created by doctors, including classification follow-ups using the HorusBlink feature (based on the EfficientNet-B7 CNN model) to classify histopathology samples as malignant or benign, and detection follow-ups using the HorusVision feature (based on the YOLOv9 model) to segment tumors in mammograms, extract tumor images and dimensions, and allow for modification and detailed annotation. The system generates comprehensive medical reports incorporating model results and doctor notes, stores these reports for future access, and distributes them via email to both patients and responsible radiation therapists, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

**Features:**

- HorusVision: allow doctors to detect tumors in MRI scans and measure their sizes.
- HorusBlink: enables doctors to classify histopathology samples as benign or malignant with high efficiency.
- Report Generation: Each followup generates a detailed report that formalizes the model results alongside the doctor's notes and
conclusions. Notably, doctors can refine tumor predictions, adjust sizes, and add notes or conclusions
-  Each patient profile maintains a list of follow-ups for thorough and organized tracking.


**Technologies:**
- Deep Learning: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV, TensorFlow,
